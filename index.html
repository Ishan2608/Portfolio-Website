                <p>
                    As a presenter, I had the opportunity to deliver impactful presentations and engage with audiences, including school children, to educate them about the detrimental effects of air pollution and the importance of clean air. Through interactive sessions and engaging visuals, I played a pivotal role in spreading awareness, inspiring behavioral changes, and fostering a sense of environmental responsibility among the youth.
