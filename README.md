# Portfolio-Website
I have created this website as a project assignment of the course I pursed on Udemy. <br>
The course is 100 Days of Code - Complete Python Bootcamp, by Dr. Angela Yu. <br>
I have excluded some projects and certificates that I had gained in other areas as including them would have made the site look incomplete due to their short quantity.
Thus I have included only what I gained from this python course. I just needed something to showcase all of my Projects in one place, and sum up the skills I have gained.
